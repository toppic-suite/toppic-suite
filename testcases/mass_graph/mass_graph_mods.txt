# This file is used to specify modifications
# # for comments
# To input a modification, use the following format:
#
# Name,Mass,Residues,Position,UnimodID
#
# Name: name of the modification (Unimod PSI-MS name)
# 	- The Unimod PSI-MS names are recommended
# 	- E.g. Phospho, Acetyl
# 	- Visit http://www.unimod.org to get PSI-MS names.
#
# Mass: monoisotopic mass of modification. 
#   - It is important to specify accurate masses (integer masses are insufficient).
# 	- E.g. 15.994915 
#
# Residues: amino acids that can be modified
# 	- Use * if this modification is applicable to all the 20 amino acids. 
#
# Position: positions in the protein where the modification can be attached. 
# 	- One of the following three values should be used:
# 	- any (anywhere), N-term, C-term
#
# UnimodID: unmimod id of the modification
#   - Please use -1, if not in unimod
