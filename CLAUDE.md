# Project conventions and migration notes

Guidance for working on this codebase (the `common/` and `seq/` layers of
TopPIC). Read this before adding or changing code in `src/common` or `src/seq`.

## Removed functions in `str_util.hpp` (use the standard library)

These thin wrappers were removed because they merely duplicated the C++ standard
library. Do **not** re-add them; call the standard function directly.

| Removed | Use instead |
|---|---|
| `str_util::toString(int)` | `std::to_string(i)` |
| `str_util::toString(size_t)` | `std::to_string(n)` |
| `str_util::scientificToDouble(s)` | `std::stod(s)` (also parses scientific notation, e.g. `"1.5e-3"`) |

Still present (kept on purpose): `toString(bool)` ("true"/"false"),
`toString(double)` and the `*ToString` formatters (custom precision logic),
`trim`, `split`, `rmComment`, and `endsWith`. `endsWith` is kept rather than
using C++20 `std::string::ends_with`, because the project targets **C++17**.

Note: `str_util` no longer depends on Boost — `trim`/`split`/`rmComment` are
implemented with the standard library; `split` reproduces the old
`boost::split + is_any_of` semantics (empty fields preserved, `""` -> `{""}`).

## Removed functions in `file_util.hpp` (use `std::filesystem`)

Only the two exact one-call `std::filesystem` duplicates were removed:

| Removed | Use instead |
|---|---|
| `file_util::exists(p)` | `std::filesystem::exists(p)` |
| `file_util::rename(a, b)` | `std::filesystem::rename(a, b)` |

The other `std::filesystem`-backed helpers are **kept** as a `std::string`
facade (they centralize error handling/logging and keep callers off `fs::path`):
`directory`, `absoluteName`, `absoluteDir`, `filenameFromEntirePath`,
`basenameFromEntirePath`, `basename`, `copyFile`, `delDir`, etc.

Watch out: `file_util::basename(s)` is **not** `fs::path::stem()` — it keeps the
directory and strips only the last extension (`/a/b/c.txt` -> `/a/b/c`), i.e. it
is `fs::path(s).replace_extension("")`. Use it, don't replace it with `stem()`.

## Migrating XML code from Xerces-C++ to pugixml — possible bites

`common/xml` is fully on **pugixml** (Xerces is gone). When migrating code that
still uses Xerces (`appendXml`/`toXmlElement`/`parseXml`, writers, base
`initBase`), watch for these:

- **Element handles, not pointers.** `XmlDOMElement` is now `pugi::xml_node` (a
  value handle), not `xercesc::DOMElement*`. Pass by value; test absence with
  `if (!node)`, not `== nullptr`.
- **No detached nodes.** `XmlDOMDocument::createElement(tag)` (detached, attach
  later) is gone. Use `addElement(parent, tag)` which creates the child **already
  attached** to `parent` and returns it. Build the subtree under the returned
  node. `createTextNode` folds into `addElement(parent, tag, value)`.
- **No serializer object.** Use `xml_dom_util::writeToString(node)` (a node
  method underneath), not `writeToString(serializer, node)`.
- **No `DOMImplementation` singleton.** `XmlDOMImplFactory` / `createSerializer`
  are gone; `xml_dom_impl::createDoc(root)` returns a `unique_ptr<xml_document>`.
- **Parsing.** `XmlDOMParser::parse(file)` / `parseStr(buffer)` return
  `std::unique_ptr<pugi::xml_document>`; there is no `MemBufInputSource` and no
  `XMLPlatformUtils` init. Construct `XmlDOMDocument` from the returned doc.
- **RAII.** `XmlDOMDocument` owns its document; there is no `release()`.
- **Errors.** pugixml has no SAX error handler. Parse errors come back as an
  `xml_parse_result`; `xml_dom_err_handler::checkParseResult(result, name, src)`
  logs and throws (reporting line:column when `src` is provided).

### The semantic gotcha (most important)

Xerces `getElementsByTagName(tag)` searches **all descendants** (any depth, in
document order). pugixml `node.children(tag)` returns only **direct children**.
The migrated `xml_dom_util::getChildElement/getChildValue/getChildCount` use
**direct children**. An audit confirmed this is safe for TopPIC's existing XML
(it is read level-by-level and every collection is wrapped in a dedicated
`*_list` element), so direct-children and descendant search coincide there.

But if you write/query XML where the **same tag nests at multiple depths under
the queried element**, the two differ (count and indexing), e.g. counting
`<name>` on a `<mod>` whose subtree also has `<name>` deeper. If you genuinely
need the descendant search, use pugixml XPath: `parent.select_nodes(".//tag")`
(sort for document order). Also note `getTextContent` (concatenates all
descendant text) became `text().as_string()` (first PCDATA) — identical for leaf
value elements, different for mixed content. pugixml assumes UTF-8 and has
minimal XML-namespace support.

## Header include order (required)

All `.cpp` and `.hpp` files use the standard (Google-style) order. Each group is
**alphabetical** and separated from the next by **one blank line**:

1. **The related header** — for a `.cpp`, its own `.hpp`, on the first line.
2. **C++ standard library** headers (`<string>`, `<cmath>`, `<cstddef>`, ...).
3. **Platform / system headers**, including `#if`-guarded blocks (`<windows.h>`,
   `<unistd.h>`, `<mach/mach.h>`, ...).
4. **Third-party** headers (`<pugixml.hpp>`, `<boost/...>`).
5. **Project** headers (`"common/..."`).

A `.hpp` follows the same order without step 1. Putting the related header first
keeps each header self-contained. Include hygiene is checked with
include-what-you-use (configure with `-DTOPPIC_ENABLE_IWYU=ON`, or run
`iwyu_tool -p <build>`); keep new files IWYU-clean.

## Parameter passing (smart pointers and handles)

The `...Ptr` typedefs are `std::shared_ptr` aliases. A `shared_ptr` is 16 bytes
and a by-value pass does an **atomic** refcount inc/dec on every call, so:

- **Read-only `shared_ptr` params → `const&`.** `void f(const ModPtr &p)`, not
  `void f(ModPtr p)`. Same for `std::shared_ptr<T>` written out. This is applied
  throughout `seq` and `common/base`; keep new code consistent.
- **Sink params that store the pointer → by value + `std::move`.** A setter or
  constructor that *keeps* its argument takes it by value and moves it into the
  member (`void setX(ModPtr p) { x_ = std::move(p); }`). Do **not** "fix" these
  to `const&` — that would force a copy on assignment.
- **`...PtrVec` (and other container) params → `const&`** when read-only.
- **`XmlDOMElement` stays by value** — see the pugixml section above. It is a
  trivially-copyable 8-byte handle (`pugi::xml_node` wraps a single pointer), so
  `const&` would only add a layer of indirection. The same reasoning applies to
  any thin handle/iterator-like type.

Scalars (`int`, `double`, `bool`, ...) stay by value. The one risk `const&`
introduces and the compiler will **not** catch: if a function mutates the
container its `shared_ptr` argument was passed from while still using the
argument, the reference can dangle — pass such an argument by value.

## Vendored htslib (`seq` indexed-FASTA access)

`seq/fasta_index_reader` uses htslib's `faidx` API for random access into
`.fai`-indexed FASTA files. A **trimmed** copy of htslib (only `faidx`, `bgzf`
and `hfile` — the C sources plus their headers) is vendored under `ext/htslib`,
mirroring how the upstream TopPIC tree carries it. It is built by `CMakeLists.txt`
as a small static library `htslib` (links `ZLIB::ZLIB` and `Threads::Threads`,
compiled with `-w` and PIC) and linked **PRIVATE** into `toppic_common`; the
`ext/` directory is a **PUBLIC** include root because the vendored sources
include themselves as `"htslib/<name>.h"` and `fasta_index_reader.hpp` exposes
`<htslib/faidx.h>`.

Notes:
- It is third-party C code: do not reformat it or hold it to this project's
  include-order / IWYU rules. The `-w` flag deliberately silences its warnings.
- do not add htslib calls outside `seq` without reason.

## Other external dependencies

Besides pugixml (XML) and the vendored htslib (indexed FASTA), the layers below
pull in a few system libraries, all found via `find_package`/the default include
path and linked into `toppic_common`:

- **SQLite3** (`find_package(SQLite3)` → `SQLite::SQLite3`) — used by
  `sql/sql_util` and `ms/mzml/mzml_ms_sql_writer`. The latter is the single-file
  store for deconvoluted MS1/MS2 spectra (it replaced an earlier one-JSON-file-
  per-scan writer): it inserts via reused prepared statements batched into
  chunked transactions under bulk-load PRAGMAs, so it scales to many scans.
  **Interface note:** `mzml_ms_sql_writer` is the stateful class
  `MzmlMsSqlWriter` (construct once, call `writeMs1`/`writeMs2` per spectrum, let
  it destruct to flush the final transaction), **not** the old
  `mzml_ms_sql_writer::writeMs1/writeMs2(sqlite3*, ...)` free functions — the
  batching needs state a per-call free function can't hold. The caller still owns
  the connection (opens it, creates the schema, closes it). When migrating the
  upstream topfd driver that wrote spectra, adopt the object; do not reintroduce
  per-call free-function wrappers (they would restore the per-scan
  transaction/prepare cost this rewrite removed).
- **Boost** — `find_package(Boost ... COMPONENTS filesystem iostreams thread
  chrono system serialization program_options)`. `ms/mzml`'s pwiz reader needs
  `filesystem`/`iostreams`/`thread`/`chrono`/`system`; `filter/massmatch/
  mass_match` needs `serialization` (its binary index archive — linked PUBLIC
  into `toppic_common` because the header exposes `boost::serialization::access`);
  the GUI argument parsers need `program_options`. `search/graph` additionally
  uses the **header-only** Boost Graph Library (no link). Prefer `std::mutex` etc.
  over `boost::*` in our own code (the filter/index mutexes were converted from
  `boost::mutex`; only `mass_match`'s serialization genuinely needs Boost). (Boost
  headers pulled in through the third-party `ext/` tree are silenced by the
  system-include treatment below; if you include a Boost header directly in our
  own code and it warns — e.g. uBLAS still deriving from the C++17-deprecated
  `std::iterator` — wrap it in `#pragma GCC diagnostic ignored
  "-Wdeprecated-declarations"`.)
- **Qt5** — `find_package(Qt5 COMPONENTS Widgets Core Gui)` backs the `src/gui`
  desktop executables (see the source-layout note). Only the GUI targets use it,
  via per-target `AUTOMOC`/`AUTOUIC`/`AUTORCC`; the `toppic_common` library has
  no Qt dependency.
- **ProteoWizard (pwiz)** — a trimmed copy is vendored under `ext/pwiz` (only the
  `utility/minimxml`, `utility/misc`, `data/common`, `data/msdata` source dirs
  are compiled; the rest is headers), built as a static `pwiz` library against
  Boost + zlib with `WITHOUT_MZ5` (so no HDF5). `ms/mzml/pw_ms_reader` uses it to
  read mzML/mzMLb. pwiz uses its own `minimxml` parser, **not** Xerces. It needs
  a few Boost pieces the system package lacks (`boost/nowide`, the `boost::enums`
  library, `foreach_field.hpp`); those are vendored under `ext/boost`, which
  `ext/` (the include root) resolves ahead of the system Boost while everything
  else still comes from the system. Treat `ext/pwiz` and `ext/boost` as
  third-party: do not reformat them or hold them to the IWYU/include-order rules.
  Their `.cpp` files are built with `-w`; the `ext/` directory is added to every
  target as a **`SYSTEM`** include (`-isystem`), so warnings from vendored
  headers are silenced even when our own `-Wall` sources include them.
- **ONNX Runtime** — `topfd/envcnn` and `topfd/ecscore/score` run the EnvCNN /
  ECScore neural-network models through the ONNX Runtime C++ API. A prebuilt
  `libonnxruntime.so.1.14.1` and the C/C++ API headers are vendored under
  `ext/onnx` (sources include it as `"onnx/onnxruntime_cxx_api.h"`, covered by
  the `SYSTEM` `ext/` include); it is linked as an `IMPORTED` shared object,
  `PRIVATE`, into `toppic_common`. Treat it as third-party.

## Install and uninstall (`make install` / `make uninstall`)

`make install` is defined by three rules in `CMakeLists.txt`, all relative to
`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` (default `/usr/local`), so `DESTDIR` staging and a
custom prefix both work:

- `install(TARGETS ${TOPPIC_EXECUTABLES} ...)` puts the six CLI tools and their
  six `*_gui` counterparts in `<prefix>/bin`. **When you add a new executable
  target, append it to the `TOPPIC_EXECUTABLES` list** (end of the file) so it
  is installed and gets the rpath below — nothing else is needed.
- On Linux the vendored `ext/onnx/libonnxruntime.so.1.14.1` (which every
  executable loads at run time, via `toppic_common`) is installed to
  `<prefix>/${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}` (= `lib/toppic`), and the executables get
  `INSTALL_RPATH "$ORIGIN/../lib/toppic"` so the installed tree is relocatable.
  In the build tree CMake already points the rpath at `ext/onnx`, so `bin/`
  works without installing. Keep the `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` value and this
  rpath in sync.
- `install(DIRECTORY res/ ...)` copies the runtime resources into
  `<prefix>/${CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR}` (= `share/toppic`), which is also the
  compiled-in `TOPPIC_SHARED_DIR` the binaries look in.

`make uninstall` is a custom target (CMake has no built-in one). It runs
`cmake -P <build>/cmake_uninstall.cmake`, configured from
`cmake/cmake_uninstall.cmake.in`, which reads the `install_manifest.txt` that
`make install` writes into the **build directory**, deletes every file listed
there (honouring `DESTDIR`) and then removes any directory under the prefix
that was left empty (the manifest lists files only). Consequences:

- It must be run from the same build directory as the install; without a
  manifest it fails with a clear error rather than guessing.
- Anything added through a normal `install(...)` rule is uninstalled
  automatically — do not add per-file removal code to the script.
- Running it twice is harmless (missing files are reported, not errors).

## Source layout

`src` is the include root, so headers are included by their path from `src`
(`common/...`, `seq/...`, `ms/spec/...`, `para/...`, `sql/...`). All of the
following compile into the single `toppic_common` **OBJECT** library (the
`COMMON_SRCS` glob in `CMakeLists.txt` lists each directory) — its object files
are linked directly into each executable, so **no `libtoppic_common.so`/`.a` is
built**; the executables are self-contained. Each layer depends only on the ones
above it, never the reverse:

- `src/common` — foundation: `base`, `util`, `xml`, `thread`.
- `src/sql` — thin SQLite helper (`sql_util`).
- `src/para` — analysis parameters (`sp_para`, `peak_tolerance`, `prsm_para`).
- `src/seq` — sequence/proteoform layer.
- `src/ms` — mass-spectrum layer: `spec` (peaks/spectra/msalign), `msmap`,
  `factory`, `env` (envelope detection), `feature`, `mzml`.
- `src/topfd` — the TopFD deconvolution/feature-detection layer, built on `ms`:
  `common` (`topfd_para` config + the `topfd_process`/`topfd_single_process`
  orchestrators), `dp` (dynamic-programming envelope assignment), `envcnn` and
  `ecscore/score` (the EnvCNN / ECScore neural-network scorers, via ONNX
  Runtime), `deconv`, and `ecscore` (`env`/`env_set`/`env_coll`/`para`/`score`).
  Note two folder-level cycles handled by the single-library glob: `dp <-> deconv`
  and `ecscore/env_coll <-> ecscore/score`. `deconv` constructs the
  `MzmlMsSqlWriter` (see the SQLite note) once per run, shared across its worker
  threads; it no longer writes per-scan JSON.
- `src/topdia` — the TopDIA pseudo-spectrum layer built on `topfd`/`ms`:
  `common` (`topdia_para` + `topdia_process`) and `pseudo_spec`
  (`mzrt_feature`, `pseudo_peak`, `pseudo_spectrum`, `generate_pseudo_spectrum`).
- `src/prsm` — proteoform-spectrum-match layer (`Prsm`/`SimplePrsm`, readers,
  writers, FDR, clustering, coverage). `prsm`/`simple_prsm`/`expected_value`/
  `peak_ion_pair` carry the pugixml XML (de)serialization (`toXmlElement`/`toXml`/
  `appendXml` take a parent `XmlDOMElement` and return the attached node).
- `src/filter` — proteoform filtering (`diag`/`index`/`massmatch`/`mng`/
  `oneptm`/`varptm`/`zeroptm`). `massmatch/mass_match` (de)serializes its binary
  index with Boost.Serialization. The file-global `serial_mutex` (and the other
  filter/index mutexes) live in **anonymous namespaces** — they previously had
  external linkage and the same name in several TUs, which only becomes a
  multiple-definition error once everything compiles into one library.
- `src/search` — sequence/spectrum alignment (`diag`/`graph`/`graphalign`/
  `oneptmsearch`/`ptmsearch`/`varptmsearch`/`zeroptmsearch`). `graph` uses the
  header-only Boost Graph Library (`adjacency_list`, `graph_traits`, `graphviz`).
- `src/stat` — E-value/p-value estimation (`count`/`local`/`mcmc`/`tdgf`).
- `src/merge` — the topdiff feature-merge backend (`feature_prsm`,
  `feature_sample_merge`), used by `console/topdiff_process`.

These are all library layers. The **executable** layers are separate (they are
NOT in `COMMON_SRCS`; each is its own `add_executable` that links
`toppic_common`):

- `src/console` — the command-line tools. Each is a `main()` (`topfd.cpp`,
  `topdia.cpp`, `topindex.cpp`, `toppic.cpp`, `topmg.cpp`, `topdiff.cpp`) plus
  its `<tool>_argument.cpp` parser (`boost::program_options`) plus, for the four
  multi-step tools, its `<tool>_process.cpp` orchestrator. topfd/topdia have no
  `*_process` here — they drive the `topfd_process`/`topdia_process`
  orchestrators that live in the library. The `toppic_console_exe()` helper in
  `CMakeLists.txt` builds each, linking `toppic_common` + `Boost::program_options`.
- `src/gui` — Qt5 desktop front-ends (`topfd`/`topindex`/`toppic`/`topmg`/
  `topdiff`/`topdia`, plus `util` = a QProcess command builder + message
  helpers). The `toppic_gui_exe()` helper in `CMakeLists.txt` defines each
  target with per-target `AUTOMOC`/`AUTOUIC`/`AUTORCC` and
  `AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS=src` (so the dialogs' `"gui/<tool>/ui_*.h"` includes
  resolve), linking `toppic_common` + `Qt5::Widgets/Core/Gui` +
  `Boost::program_options`. A dialog collects parameters and **shells out** to
  the matching CLI tool via QProcess, reading its default values from that
  tool's console argument parser. `src/gui/topmerge` is migrated but has no
  target (no `topmerge` CLI tool drives the `merge` backend yet).

The `<tool>_argument.cpp` parsers are compiled into both the CLI tool and its
GUI (each target compiles its own object — no shared lib for them). When
migrating the remaining `*_process` drivers, drop the leftover
`xercesc::XMLPlatformUtils::Initialize()` calls — pugixml needs no global init.

When migrating a folder from the upstream Xerces tree, watch for include guards
that don't match the destination path (e.g. an `ms/env` file guarded
`TOPPIC_TOPFD_ENV_*`, or filter subdirs split as `ONE_PTM`/`VAR_PTM`) and
rename them to `TOPPIC_<PATH>_<FILE>_HPP_`. Three recurring upstream bites: a
missing `;` after a `LOG_ERROR(...)`/`LOG_DEBUG(...)` (our logger macro is a
`do {…} while(0)`, so it needs the terminator the upstream code omits); the
`str_util::toString(int)` calls that must become `std::to_string` (keep the
`toString(double)` ones — see the str_util table above); and a by-value Ptr/
container parameter that the function sorts/mutates in place, which must NOT be
"upgraded" to `const&` (it will not compile).
